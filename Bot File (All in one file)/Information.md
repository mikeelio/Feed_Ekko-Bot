# Feed_Ekko-Bot

This bot is created into one file. This is not the official bot but more of a testing if all the commands work in a certain way.
I wouldn't recommend running this bot but like if you don't care about changing things go nuts.

Things to install:
Python 3.6.5 or higher
FFmpeg
youtube-dl
ImgurClient(For the anime commands) https://github.com/Imgur/imgurpython
MySQL -> I used WampServer cause I can use the database and host a website which I shall sooner or later idk stop asking me.

I think that should be it?
